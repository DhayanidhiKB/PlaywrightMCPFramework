Try to write all permutations and combinations of Testcases include positive and negative scenarios
create a testcase.MD file with all the information which can be used to create automation cases later



Using the attached testcase.md file as the only reference, generate an automated test framework using Playwright with TypeScript, implementing the Page Object Model (POM).

Scope:

Automate only the first 10 test cases from testcase.md

Each automated test must clearly map to its corresponding test case ID and description

Technical Requirements:

Use Playwright Test with TypeScript

Follow Page Object Model (POM) with reusable page classes

Use Playwright fixtures for setup and teardown

Prefer getByRole, getByLabel, getByTestId selectors

No hard-coded waits (waitForTimeout)

Centralize selectors inside page objects

Use strong assertions with expect

Keep the framework scalable and maintainable

Deliverables (Must Be Ready to Execute):

Project folder structure

package.json

playwright.config.ts

Page Object files for pages involved in the first 10 test cases

Test spec files implementing the first 10 test cases

Reusable utilities (base page, test data, helpers if applicable)

README.md with:

Prerequisites

Installation steps

Test execution commands

Output Instructions:

Output each file in a separate code block

Clearly label each block with its relative file path

Ensure the solution runs successfully with:

npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
